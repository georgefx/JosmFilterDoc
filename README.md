# JOSM filter/search grammar documentation

This repository contains documentation of the [JOSM](https://github.com/JOSM/josm) filter/search grammar that on the one hand has been gleaned from the text displayed on JOSMs search modal, 
and on the other hand from inspection of the JOSM code by other contributors, in particular by @Woazboat 

This was necessary to develop [JosmFilterParser](https://github.com/simonpoole/JosmFilterParser) without running in to potential licence issues, and on the other hand it does have the nice 
side effect of the grammar actually being documented in a reasonable form.

The documentation is in [filter.md](filter.md) please feel free to submit pull requests if you have found something that is missing or special behaviout that needs documenting.
